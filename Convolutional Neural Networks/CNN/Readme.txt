Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in PyTorch. The data set
(i.e. Fashion-MNIST)
Implementing CNNs using PyTorch.
– Define the architecture with just 2 convolutional layers to extract features from the images and then use a fully connected dense layer to classify those features into their respective categories (i.e. two Conv2d layers and a linear layer).
– Train the model for 25 epochs and show the validation losses by printing in console. You are expected to see that the validation loss is decreasing as epoch increases.
– Visualize the training and validation losses by plotting them.
– Show the accuracy of the model on the training and validation set.
